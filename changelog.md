# Changelog

## v1.2.2beta
* Production: now shows timer how long its running until finished (CPU usage reduced by 100%)
* Overview: Executiontime is back in the hood. How long did the Bot run again?
* Translation completed in German and English
* Bots: Currently the Bot is under development. Currently, if you activate him, he will start new production as soon as you collect them. I am on it to fix the problems I have with a working bot. After fixing this Bot, I will work on the next one (which will be one for Recurring-Quests, but can take a long time, because I will keep some sort of customization with out adding to much complexity)

If the language in your mother tongue is missing. Please clone the project, create a new JSON-File with the language code (de -> german, en -> english, fr -> french and so on) and make a Pullrequest with the new one. If you dont know how to do it, just open a Issue with the title:
[TRANSLATE] [*your language code*]
and no more text.
I will contact you back.
